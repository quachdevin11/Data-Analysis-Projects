# Case Study: Cyclistic Bike-Share
This case study was done to apply the knowledge acquired through Googleâ€™s Data Analysis Professional Certification program to conduct an in-depth case study differentiating between casual riders and members of a bike-sharing company. The project involved executing comprehensive data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis using R Studio and developing actionable recommendations to the company.
