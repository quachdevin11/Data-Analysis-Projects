# Introduction: 
The purpose of this project was to create a Tableau dashboard visualizing the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) Sport Benefits Statements for 2019-2020. Additionally, the project included creating an educational resource about how to clean the data before using it. This educational resource is intended for a non-technical audience.   

## Background Information:
Since 2019, the USOPC has published annual Sport Benefits Statements for each of the 56 National Governing Bodies. These statements provide an overview highlighting how the USOPC allocates resources directly to athletes and in support of athletes through these organizations. 


## Dataset Overview:
- Sport Benefits Statements Data.xlsx - Aggregated data solely on the High-Performance Programs and Athlete Training Facilities 
- NGBHealthDataOuptut Extract.csv - Background information regarding each NGB including statistics such as membership, staff and revenue data

## Process: 
This project required cleaning, compiling, visualizing and communicating data using Excel and Tableau.  

## Final Output:
The final interactive dashboard can be viewed and downloaded from Tableau Public at this link: https://public.tableau.com/views/SportBenefitsStatementsOverview-DQ/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link. It is also within this GitHub directory. 

The educational resource is the word document within this GitHub directory.
